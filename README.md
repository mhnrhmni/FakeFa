# FakeFarsi
 
This package, developed with Python language, is used to generate fake information including name, surname, age, phone number and email of a fake Iranian person. In Python, there was such a package called Faker, which provided fake information of a foreigner, but now we have fixed this problem for Iranians and we will improve it day by day.

Creating fake profiles can serve various purposes, from testing software applications to conducting research on user behavior. In this project, we explore the generation of fictional profiles using Farsi (Persian) names and other details.We randomly select first names from a list of both male and female Farsi names.Similarly, we choose last names from a predefined list.Combining a randomly selected first name and last name gives us a complete name for the fake profile.We generate a random age between 10 and 99 years for each profile.A fake phone number is created with the format “09XXXXXXXXX,” where X represents digits.The first digit is chosen from a restricted set (1, 3, or 9) to match Iranian mobile phone prefixes.We translate the Farsi first name and last name into English characters.We combine the generated information (name, age, phone number, and email) to create a complete fake profile.Creating fake profiles can be useful for testing, data anonymization, or educational purposes. By following the steps outlined above, we can quickly generate fictional profiles in Farsi.

In our fictional profiles project, we delve deeper into the intricacies of creating these Farsi-based personas. Let’s explore additional aspects:Address and Location:We can invent imaginary addresses, cities, and regions for our profiles.Consider incorporating elements like street names, postal codes, and even landmarks.Occupation and Interests:Assigning occupations or fields of interest to our profiles adds realism.Perhaps some profiles are engineers, artists, or avid travelers.Mention hobbies, favorite books, or sports they enjoy.Profile Pictures:Although we’re working with text, we can imagine profile pictures.Describe their appearance: hair color, eye shape, and any distinguishing features.Social Media Presence:What if our fake profiles had social media accounts?Invent usernames, hashtags they use, and posts they might share.Remember, these profiles are entirely fictional, but the more details we add, the richer they become.
